<h2>Future possibilites & What to improve</h2>
<p>In this project I wanted to learn by coding myself as much as possible as this is my first React Native & GraphQL app project. Therefore I have tried to limit used libraries and create functionalities and components by myself.</p>

<p>The code is not yet as clean as possible and some of the features are not fully working yet, but those will be improved lateron. :) </p>

<p>Features that still need shaping:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Editing recipes works in backend but not yet in frontend.
</li>
<li>
Filtering recipes works in backend but not yet in frontend.
</li>
<li>
Sign in both in backend and frontend
</li>
</ul>
